# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

  * It felt good! There were definitely some things that felt hard, and I think I was a bit taken aback by the amount of "figuring out" outside of the things that were explicitly covered in the lesson we were required to do. But because of the foundations that we had laid over the course of the week, that sort of challenge was less scary and more fun. I reached out to my small group and also did some experimenting and soon enough had figured it out.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

  * Today was definitely the most difficult because it required a lot of coordination with others (both lessons were collaborative and then there was the pairing and the eval), so it was a bit harder to organize my own schedule. But overall I pretty good about workflow and focus. Taking breaks is something I still need to work on following through with.

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

  * There are some work-space things I really need to get sorted out before we start mod 1. But overall feeling just really excited, and looking forward to it :)
